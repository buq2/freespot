Write a plan for implementing the project. Ask clarifying questions for both technical/software side and for the application functionality

 Technical answers: 1) Use vite for the project setup 2) I do not have preference how state is managed. Keep it simple. Update the calculations in real-time. Cache the         ││   weather information. Update weather information if the landing spot changes more than 1km or time time changes more than 1h. 3) Yes, create tests for the physics              ││   calculation. The compatibility should be for desktop and mobile, Chrome, Firefox and iOS. Only modern browsers. Include error boundaries and logging. Application              ││   functionality: 1) Use integration which takes into account wind direction changes. Take into account terrain elevation as usually the weather models give the altitudes from   ││   the sea level, not from the ground level. 2) The map should default to current user location. Let's start with reasonable defaults, no need to have multiple presets. Show     ││   visual warnings for high ground winds (8m/s student max, 11m/s for sport, make these configurable) 3) The weather forecast data should be fetched for the given day. No need   ││   to fetch historical weather data. Fetch the weather information for all elevation levels the given model supports. 4) No need to support multiple landing zones. Make          ││   visualization of the freewall drift for the groups optional. No need for "reverse calculation". Write a plan for the implementation in PLAN.md.
